1. Create a path in your home directory - "projects/learn-python"
2. Copy attached file with tasks there
3. Rename the file to task_for_%your_track_name%.txt
4. Sign up on github.com and create a repoistory with name "learn-python" there
5. Init git in "projects/learn-python", add the file with task to git and push it to github repository
6. Implement scripts for tasks described bellow, each one should be in separate file (names may be like task1.py, task2.py and so on), files should be located in "projects/learn-python/tasks" folder
7. Commit and push scripts to git repository

Tasks 

Task 1
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Task 2
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
40320

Task 3
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
8
Then, the output should be:
{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

Task 4
Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
34,67,55,33,12,98
Then, the output should be:
['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')

Task 5
Define a class which has at least two methods:
getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.
Also please include simple test function to test the class methods.
